# About
This is a collection of functions I created for AHK and Python with the purpose of automating different aspects of the game [NGU-IDLE](https://www.kongregate.com/games/somethingggg/ngu-idle). This project first started because the built-in functions ControlClick/ControlSend in AHK did not work with the game, because of how Unity handles input. I first created replacements for these functions in AHK, but later moved over to Python because there was little reason to use AHK when the input was being sent directly via the Windows API.

### Features
These functions will send input to the game without using your keyboard or mouse, and they don't require the window to be active. The supplied functions found in the `classes` directory can help you create your own scripts to run. You can also see my implementations in the top-level `.py` files (except `constants.py` and `coordinates.py`) for inspiration of what you can do. WARNING: These scripts are subject to frequent change.
Check the blame as well for even further inspiration!

### Disclaimer
If you're automating the game using these or any other scripts, please consider disabling the high score submissions in the game settings.

The AHK script is unsupported and deleted. They will work well in any Unity based browser game, where AHK's builtins fall short. If you want them, check the AHK branch https://github.com/kujan/NGU-scripts/tree/AHK.

## Requirements
* Windows 7 or later (NT >=6.1)
* Python 3.7
* Tesseract OCR
* Firefox Browser with hardware acceleration turned OFF (you have to restart the browser for it to take effect). If you wish to script on steam/kartridge check out  [jasperfirecai2's fork](https://github.com/jasperfirecai2/NGU-scripts) or the kartridge branch on this repo (out of date). These alternatives DO NOT work in the background, they will use your mouse and keyboard.
* Use scientific notation in game
* The "simple inventory shortcuts" setting must be enabled
* The normal theme must be enabled
* Fancy titan HP bars must be disabled if using the ``kill_titan()`` method
* If you plan on using wishes/R3 I strongly recommend you to name your R3 to 'R' and use the green background, otherwise you will get spotty results from Tesseract. It's also strongly recommended to have 50 speed in all 3 resources.

## Installation
Install Python dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases) and add it to your [PATH variable](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/).

Remember to restart your command prompt/IDE after changing your environment variables.

Change the settings in ``usersettings_example.py`` and rename it to ``usersettings.py``

### Big Monitors
If you are using a big monitor (4K, 8K) or by some reason your Windows scaling is set to something other than 100%, the scripts won't work.
To solve this, on Firefox go to ```about:config``` and set ```layout.css.devPixelsPerPx``` to ```1.0```.

### Optional
If you're using Firefox as your main browser, you will notice that the script will steal focus each time it performs an action. To solve this you can create a specific profile that only runs the game. 

1. In firefox enter ``about:profiles`` in the address field.
2. Create a new profile and name it (NGU, for example)
3. Go to your firefox installation folder, right click the ``firefox.exe`` file
   and select create shortcut.
4. Right click the shortcut and select properties.
5. In the target field, enter ``-P YOURPROFILENAME -no-remote`` after the quotation mark. It should look like this: ``"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -P NGU -no-remote``
6. Start firefox via the shortcut and load your NGU save.

## FAQ
* Q: I get a ``ValueError``.

You're probably trying to cast a result from `ocr()`, that returns a string which might be empty or contain non-numeric characters. Use [try/except](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions) to handle this appropriately.

* Q: I get a ``IndexError: image index out of range`` error from ``pixel_search()``.

You're either sending invalid coordinates to the function, or the ``Window`` class contains invalid offsets. You can debug this by printing ``Window.x`` and ``Window.y``, and you can also make the ``get_bitmap()`` function save the bitmap to disk in order to see what the script can see. This error usually occurs because the script has found the wrong window (it searches for `play ngu idle` in the window title) if you have multiple game sessions running it might not use the correct one. This error will also occur if you lock the computer screen, or if Windows put your monitors to sleep due to power settings. This can be changed in your power settings in Windows. However if you're using DisplayPort and you physically turn your monitors off, Windows might change the desktop resolution for some reason, causing the script to crash. If this is causing problems, there's a fix [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/windows-7-movesresizes-windows-on-monitor-power/1653aafb-848b-464a-8c69-1a68fbd106aa).

* Q: I get a ``TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object`` error from ``pixel_search()``.

Make sure you have the game running in Firefox, and that the window is NOT minimized, you cannot minimize the window while running, but you can have other windows on top of the game window just fine. This error will also occur if you lock the computer screen, or if Windows put your monitors to sleep due to power settings. See answer above if you're using DisplayPort.
This can also happen on big monitors, as the search area might be too little. Try changing the script to ```pixel_search(coords.TOP_LEFT_COLOR, 0, 0, 2000, 1000)``` instead. Note that reducing Firefox windows size can make this search area be out of bounds and throw an error.

* Q: I get a ``pywintypes.error: (0, 'GetPixel', 'No error message is available')`` error.

This can happen for various reasons, see answers above because they all apply to this. Some full-screen games have been reportedly causing this, also video card driver crashes will cause this error as well.
